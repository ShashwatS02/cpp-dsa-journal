# 📘 C++ DSA Journal

This repository documents my structured daily progress in mastering C++ for DSA and placements. All programs are categorized day-wise.

---

## 📅 Day 01 – Basics

- ✏️ Arithmetic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`
- 🧮 Variable declarations: `int`, `char`, `float`, `double`, `bool`
- 📤 Console output using `cout`

---

## 📅 Day 02 – Conditionals, Loops, Input

- 🔢 Practiced `if`, `else if`, and `else` branches
- 📥 Took input from user using `cin`
- 🔁 Implemented `for` loops for even numbers, squares, and World Cup chant
- 🎯 Basic typecasting: `int` to `char`, and vice versa

---

📅 Day 03 – Loop Applications & Number Practice

🔁 Practiced numeric loops: counting, reverse, even-steps  
🔡 Printed character sequences (A–Z) using loops  
➕ Built summation and factorial logic via iterative loops  
📊 Wrote code to calculate power, check prime, and generate multiplication tables  
🧠 Solved mini-problems using loop-based logic: Fibonacci, squares, cubes

---

📅 Day 04 – Pattern Printing with Nested Loops

🔁 Practiced square and triangular patterns using nested `for` loops  
🔢 Printed number grids, sequences, and continuous counters  
🔡 Generated alphabet grids using ASCII character math  
🌟 Built pyramid and triangular patterns using `*` and numeric logic  
🧠 Improved understanding of loop structure, row-column iteration, and formatting output

---

📅 Day 05 – Advanced Pattern Printing

🔁 Explored reverse triangle and pyramid-style patterns using nested loops  
🔢 Printed decreasing and increasing sequences row-wise (e.g., `5 4 3 2 1`, `1 2 3 4 5`)  
🔠 Practiced alphabet-based patterns with characters like `A B C`, `a a a`  
📐 Built right-aligned pyramids using space padding (`"  "`) and numbers/characters  
🧠 Gained deeper understanding of row-column relationships, spacing, and reverse logic

---

📅 Day 06 – Complex Pattern Designs & Mirrored Structures

📐 Created pyramid, triangle, and mirrored patterns using nested loops  
🔠 Printed character-based palindromes and reverse-alphabet pyramids  
🔢 Generated square, cube, and numeric pyramids with spacing logic  
🌗 Built symmetric top-bottom and left-right aligned patterns  
🧠 Practiced ASCII math for characters and refined formatting skills
